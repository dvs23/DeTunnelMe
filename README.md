# DeTunnelMe

**Wake your teammates with beautiful blinking LEDs!**

Do you know that? You want to talk to one of your teammates and he's "in the tunnel", wearing headphones and the only way to get his attention is to **walk** to him? Obviously that's by far too much physical work! With DeTunnelMe, you just need to use your well-trained fingers to type a slack-command (/wake [user]) or go to the webpage to wake your colleague up! 

Do not want to be disturbed, because you do... "important stuff"? No problem! Simply use the slack-command /lock [time in min.] or go to the webpage to lock yourself for 30 min.!
