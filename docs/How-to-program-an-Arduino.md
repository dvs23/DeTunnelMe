# How to program an Arduino

Basically, a good starting point is [https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/HomePage](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/HomePage)

If you really just want to burn a sketch to your Arduino, you need to do the following:

1. Open the Arduino IDE
2. File→Open and choose DeTunnelMe_*.ino from the DeTunnelMe-directory
3. Select Tools→Board→Arduino/Genuino Uno (if that's your Arduino, of course)
4. Select the right COM-Port (really often there's a description after COM# which shows you which port to use)
5. Click Upload (the →)
6. Wait until the upload has finished.
